\section*{Question 1}
Consider the following scenario: \\
Samples of emissions from three suppliers are classified for conformance to air-quality specifications. The results from 100 samples are summarized as follows:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width = 5cm]{Quiz1_Question1}
\end{center}
Let A denote the event that a sample is from supplier 1, and let B denote the event that a sample from any supplier conforms to specifications. If a disk is selected at random, determine the following probabilities. \\
Input your answers in the fractional form (do not simplify).

\subsection*{Question 1 Work}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Finding $P(A)$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Sum up all samples from supplier 1, regardless of conformity, and divide by total number of samples.
        \end{enumerate}
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{aligned}
                P(A) &= \frac{22+8}{100} \\
                     &= 30/100
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
    \item Finding $P(B')$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Sum up all samples that do not conform to specifications, regardless of supplier, and divide by total number of samples.
        \end{enumerate}
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{aligned}
                P(B') &= \frac{8 + 5 + 10}{100} \\
                     &= 23/100
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
    \item Finding $P(A \cap B)$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Find the intersection for samples from supplier 1 AND meet specifications, and divide by total number of samples.
        \end{enumerate}
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{aligned}
                P(A \cap B) &= \frac{22}{100} \\
                     &= 22/100
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
    \item Finding $P(A \cup B)$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Sum up all supplies that are from supplier 1, OR that meet specifications. Then divide by total number of samples.
        \end{enumerate}
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{aligned}
                P(A \cup B) &= \frac{22 + 8 + 25 + 30}{100} \\
                        &= 85/100
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
    \item Finding $P(A' \cup B)$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Sum up all supplies that are NOT from supplier 1, OR that meet specifications. Then divide by total number of samples.
        \end{enumerate}
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{aligned}
                P(A' \cup B) &= \frac{25 + 30 + 8 + 5 + 10}{100} \\
                        &= 78/100
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Question 2}
The following table summarizes the number of deceased beetles under autolysis (the destruction of a cell after its death by the action of its own enzymes) and putrefaction (decomposition of organic matter, especially protein, by microorganisms, resulting in production of foul-smelling matter):
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width = 5cm]{Quiz1_Question2}
\end{center}
Let A denote the event that autolysis is high and let B denote the event that putrefaction is high. The total number of experiments is 100.

\subsection*{Question 2 Work}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the autolysis of a sample is high, what is the probability that the putrefaction is low?
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{aligned}
                P(A \cap B') = 18/100
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
    \item If the putrefaction of a sample is high, what is the probability that the autolysis is high?
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{aligned}
                P(A \cap B) = 14/100
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
    \item If the putrefaction of a sample is low, what is the probability that the autolysis is low? 
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{aligned}
                P(A' \cap B') = 9/100
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Question 3}
The probability is 1\% that an electrical connector that is kept dry fails during the warranty period of a portable computer. If the connector is ever wet, the probability of a failure during the warranty period is 5\%. If 90\% of the connectors are kept dry and 10\% are wet, what proportion of connectors fail during the warranty period?

\subsection*{Question 3 Work}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assuming that wet and dry connectors are independent from each other, having no impact on each other.
    \item Assuming that A represents the failure of dry connectors, and B represents the failure of wet connectors
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            P(A) &= 1\% * 90\% \\
                &= 0.9\% \\
            P(B) &= 5\% * 10\% \\
                &= 0.5\% \\
            P(A \cup B) &= P(A) + P(B) \\
                &= 0.9\% + 0.5\% \\
                &= 1.4\% \quad \text{or} \quad 0.0140
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
2 Events - 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pass or Fail
    \item Dry or Wet
\end{enumerate}
Lets call both of these two events P and D respectively. Where:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        P = \text{pass} \quad P' = \text{fail} \\
        D = \text{dry} \quad D' = \text{wet} 
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
From the problem, we're given that the probability of a wet connector failing is 5\%. And on1 top of that, if 90\% of connectors are dry and 10\% wet, how many connectors fail? \\
The problem is asking us to find the total amount of connectors that failed, regardless of if they are wet or dry. Meaning we have to find:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        P(F)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Additionally, we're given the \emph{failure} rate of \emph{dry} connectors:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        P(F|D) = 0.01
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
We also given the \emph{failure} rate of \emph{wet} connectors as well:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        P(F|D') = 0.05
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Finally, we're given the amount of connectors that are \emph{dry} and amount that are \emph{wet}:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        P(D) = 0.9 \\
        P(D') = 0.1
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Now that we have all the components of the problem identified, we can now solve for the amount of failures. In order to do this, we'll use the total probability equation to plug in our components:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        P(F) &= P(F|D) * P(D) + P(F|D') * P(D') \\
        &= 0.01 * 0.9 + 0.05 * 0.1 \\
        P(F) &= 0.14
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\section*{Question 4}
Consider the well failure data given below. Let A denote the event that the geological formation of a well has more than 1000 wells, and let B denote the event that a well failed.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width = 5cm]{Quiz1_Question4}
\end{center}
Are A and B independent?

\subsection*{Question 4 Work}
Yes, they are independent from each other. However, this comes with the assumption that the well failure has no impact on the total well count - since we're not given information about how the total well count is determined.
